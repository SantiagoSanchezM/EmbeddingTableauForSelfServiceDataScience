# Embedding Tableau For Self-Service Data Science
A .NET web application that calls a predictive model in Python based on user-provided variables. Its results are stored in a SQL Server Database and then displayed within the webapp as an embedded Tableau Server visualization.

The web application is based on the code published [here](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ASPNET-MVC-Application-b4b0dc3f). Integration with Python and Tableau Server (via the JavaScript API and the REST API) are extensions built on top of it.
